"""Custom house linter (pure stdlib, AST-based).

Rules enforced:
  1. A source file longer than ``MAX_FILE_LINES`` lines fails, unless it carries
     a ``# lint: data-file`` marker within its first 15 lines. Files under a
     ``tests/`` directory are exempt from this rule.
  2. Any function decorated with ``@router.<method>`` (get/post/put/patch/delete)
     longer than ``MAX_HANDLER_LINES`` (def line to last line, decorators
     excluded) fails.
  3. Any ``test_*`` function under a ``tests/`` directory longer than
     ``MAX_TEST_LINES`` fails.

The module is importable (rules return violation lists) and runnable as
``python lint/house_lint.py`` to scan the backend tree, or with paths to scan
those instead — which is how the agent under the repository's own ``tools/``
gets looked at by the same rules.

It lives in ``lint/`` and not in a ``tools/`` of its own: there is a ``tools/``
at the repository root holding the agent, and two directories with one name is
how this file came to be linting a tree it was never pointed at.
